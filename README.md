# Frogger
My version of 1980's Arcade game - FROGGER.
I am 62 years old and new to programming.  I have been watching a lot of videos on youtube and reading a lot of info on the internet.
I understand that people are using game engines like xna(somewhat discontinued) and unity but I thought I would give it a shot at
making my own little 'game engine'. I had peviously made a version of the 11 ball game and actually tried to make some you tube videos
about it. Unfortunatelly my hard drive crashed and I lost everything.  I had heard about Github so I thought I would give it a try.

Back to Forgger.  While I tried to make it look and act like the original, I did not copy it completely.  I do not have the snakes or otters coming out,
nor did I incorporate the 'invisible' lady frog.  I may not have coded like others but it seems to work pretty good.  I hope you enjoy it.

Roger
